Model for Risk Assessment of Diabetes Inheritance for Preventive HealthCare 
Diabetes has a significant hereditary component, with genetic factors contributing to 20-80% of the disease's heritability across various populations. Despite this knowledge, many families are unaware of their potential risk for passing diabetes to their offspring. This lack of awareness can hinder necessary lifestyle adjustments that could mitigate this risk.
The increasing prevalence of diabetes, exacerbated by sedentary lifestyles, poses a substantial public health challenge, particularly for children of affected individuals or those with a familial history of the disease. These offsprings are at a markedly increased risk due to shared genetic predispositions. While specific genetic markers/factors such as TCF7L2, CAPN10, HLA-DR3, and HLA-DR4 are known to contribute to diabetes susceptibility, accessible tools for assessing the risk of diabetes inheritance based on parental DNA sequences are lacking. This gap limits proactive health management and preventive strategies for high-risk populations.

Importantly, environmental factors—over which individuals have control—also significantly influence diabetes development. The interplay between genetics and environment suggests that not all individuals with a family history will develop diabetes if they adopt healthier lifestyles from an early age. Therefore, understanding an offspring's genetic predisposition allows parents to make informed choices that promote healthier outcomes and potentially prevent the disease.

The challenge is to accurately assess and communicate the risk of diabetes inheritance from parents to offspring. Current methods often focus solely on whether parents are affected by diabetes, overlooking the broader spectrum of genetic factors that contribute to risk. A robust model is needed that takes the genetic factors into consideration regardless of parental health status and translates this information into an accessible risk score.

★	 Why is it important to focus on the risk assessment of diabetes inheritance?
➔	Diabetes is a chronic condition that currently has no cure, making prevention crucial for individuals at risk. By identifying genetic predispositions early, we can empower families to adopt healthier lifestyles and make informed choices that may prevent the onset of diabetes in their children. This proactive approach not only enhances awareness of potential risks but also fosters a culture of prevention, ultimately reducing the burden of this disease on individuals ,families and healthcare systems alike. 
Objectives:

●	Develop a Genetic Risk Assessment Model: Create a model that utilizes parental genetic data to calculate a risk score for their children, ranging from 1 (low risk) to 5 (very high risk).
●	Enhance Awareness and Preventive Action: Equip parents with a clear understanding of their genetic predisposition to diabetes, empowering them to make informed lifestyle choices that could reduce their children's risk.
●	Facilitate Data-Driven Decision Making: Provide healthcare professionals with a tool that integrates genetic data into patient consultations, enhancing personalized healthcare strategies.
Expected Outcomes:
●	Educational materials for parents explaining the significance of genetic factors in diabetes inheritance.
●	Recommendations for lifestyle modifications based on assessed risk levels.

By addressing these objectives, this project aims to bridge the gap between genetic research and practical health management, ultimately contributing to better health outcomes for future generations.
Future applications:-.
The current model only considers major genetic factors (heterozygous, homozygous, protective genes/molecules and parent of origin genes) associated with diabetes to calculate risk scores for offspring. Although this model attempts to include other factors such as protective genes/molecules, as well as the dominant nature of Parent of Origin (PoO) genes, there are still many other factors, minor and or unkown, which play a role in diabetes susceptibility. Therefore, there is significant potential for future enhancements. With further advancement and quantitative study of the genetic factors which give us a clear idea of the degree of effect each genetic factor has on increasing the genetic predisposition for diabetes, we can incorporate a broader range of genetic factors—both major and minor—associated with diabetes. This expansion will ultimately improve the reliability and accuracy of our risk assessment model.

1. Comprehensive Genetic Analysis:
By integrating findings from ongoing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and other genetic research, we can develop a more extensive database of genetic markers linked to diabetes. This will allow us to refine the risk score by considering a larger array of genetic variants, ultimately leading to a more precise assessment of an individual's predisposition to diabetes.
2. Cross-Population Validation:
To ensure the applicability of our risk assessment tool across diverse populations, future applications will focus on validating the model in various demographic groups. This will involve analyzing genetic data of populations from different countries  to enhance the tool's accuracy and relevance globally.
3. Integration with Lifestyle Factors:
Incorporating environmental and lifestyle factors into the risk assessment model will further enhance its utility. By analyzing how lifestyle choices interact with genetic predispositions, we can provide personalized recommendations that empower families to make informed decisions about health management.
